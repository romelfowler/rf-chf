											<h3>Hosting</h3>
											<p>To be able to get started using Wordpress (WP), you need purchase your domain name
											and hosting provider.</p>
											<h5>What is hosting?</h5>

											<p>

												The web-hosting or server is much like the space that you rent out to have your business in.
												It's merely the space itself. It does not include furnishings like shelves for your products,
												just as the web-hosting account doesn't include a site for you to sell your products.
												Luckily, in the web-hosting world, it's very easy to furnish the space provided by your host,
												because you can install many framework applications through the QuickInstall icon within your cPanel.
												Without the hosting services, you won't have a place for your files to reside, so your domain would then become
												like a disconnected phone number in the phone directory, and your site files would have nowhere to stay.
											</p>

										<h5>Domain Names</h5>

											<p>Next you're going to need to purchase a domain name. A domain name serves as
											the name of your website <strong>(i.e. www.mynewdomain.com).</strong> </p>

											<p>The web-hosting or server is much like the space that you rent out to have your business in.
												It's merely the space itself. It does not include furnishings like shelves for your products,
												just as the web-hosting account doesn't include a site for you to sell your products.
											Luckily, in the web-hosting world, it's very easy to furnish the space provided by your host,
											because you can install many framework applications through the QuickInstall icon within your cPanel.
											Without the hosting services, you won't have a place for your files to reside, so your domain would then become
											like a disconnected phone number in the phone directory, and your site files would have nowhere to stay.
											</p>

											<p>Hosting providers like Godaddy, Hostgator, Media Temple, Amazon all serve a purpose and that is
											to hold your files in a digital platform. Make no mistake, some hosting providers are better than others -
											but you have to spend the money for the service.</p>

											<p>Another reason to purchase a subscription with a hosting provider is that websites are always initialized. This means
											that when a website goes live, the machine that is hosting it never turns off. When the server shuts down, you have server failure
											and you will be responsible for maintaining your servers functionality. If you hosted with an external company, then you don't have
											to worry about the headache of your server potentially going offline.</p>

											<h3>Downloading Wordpress</h3>
											<p>
												Once you have set up your hosting provider, you can get started using WP by downloading it <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">here</a>.
												After downloading the files into your system using an FTP client - <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>, the next step would
												be to configure your Content Management System (CMS) by going to your domains wp-admin area.

											  <strong>(i.e. www.your-domain.com/wp-admin).</strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												The next section will highlight WP's CMS and what to expect.

								<h2>Wordpress' Content Management System (CMS)</h2>
								<div class="container">
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-5">
											<p>WP is a free, open source CMS written in PHP. WP allows a developer to create pages dynamically without
											having to code tons of HTML. WP's CMS allows a user with limited coding knowledge to be able to manage their site
											in a graphically pleasing environment. The next few paragraphs will run through sections of WP's CMS. </p>

											<h5>Post vs. Pages</h5>

										<p>
											WordPress Pages are pseudo-static pages that work outside of the WordPress Loop.
											They are used to create web pages for non-changing information like contact, about, events, schedules, history, and more.
											There is often a lot of confusion about these and some people believe that a CMS should use only Pages and not posts to populate the website.
											Posts are merely web pages that can be controlled in various ways.
											On single post pages, a web page is created with a single post or article. On multi-post pages such as categories and archives,
											many posts or articles may be displayed.
										</p>
										<p>
											The Pages are displayed like a single post page but they do not belong to
										 categories and remain "static" within the process of generating a page.
										 While posts or articles may drop down the list as new information is added to a site,
										 Pages remain accessible. In other words, they don't age.
										</p>

										<h5>Different Looks for Different Categories </h5>
										<p>
											Need to have a different look or style for different categories? Need to have specific information on different
											category pages about the information categorized there? Custom Category
											Templates can be created to change the style and content of each specific category,
											or only a few categories.
										</p>
										<h5>Control Over Archives </h5>
										<p>
											Do you need to have articles from a specific year highlighted differently from those written this year?
										</p>

											<br>
											<h5>Control Over Individual Article/Post Styles </h5>
											<p>
												While Pages can be styled different through the use of Page template files,
												you can style articles/posts on a per category basis or single post basis. For example,
												reviewing music or movies of a specific genre? You can have every post in the category for
												"Classical Music" have a style different from posts from the "Rock and Roll" category.
											</p>
											<h5>Control Over Author Pages </h5>
											<p>
												Have many authors or guest authors on your site? Need a special page with bio and
												information about what they have written on your site? Author
												Templates are customizable to allow information, styles,
												and content to reflect the different authors or author's subject matter.

													Plugins are ways to
													extend and add to the functionality that already exists in WordPress.
